Gazebo Models

Various bits and pieces of models for Gazebo

I found some really good stuff on the NVIDIA JetBot on the dusty-nv repository and copied it over.  Read below if you want to do more with the CAD files:

  Hi! From the STLs provided by dusty_nv I was able to extract Jetson Nano DevKit. Further I simplified it a bit by removing the hidden       geometry using Autodesk Meshmixer - See attachment.

  From there it can be converted into a solid and imported to Fusion/Inventor.

  EDIT â€” official CAD model of the Nano devkit is now released here:
